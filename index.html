        Connect your wallet by
        <button class="connect">clicking here</button>
      </li>
      <li>
        Check your wallet address and take note of it (it should be correct)
        <button class="address">show address</button>
      </li>
      <li>
        Close this tab, go to
        <a href="https://sequence.app">https://sequence.app</a>, log out of
        Sequence, log into a *different* Sequence wallet, and re-open this tab.
      </li>
      <li>
        Check your wallet as reported by sequence.js and take note of it (it
        will be the address you connected with, not the address Sequence
        currently is logged into)
        <button class="address">show address</button>
